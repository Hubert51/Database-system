# Database-system
Learn the database system. 
Fisrt two part is sqlite3 part. I learnt how to use SQL language in sqlite3. In demo file, I display the class I created running in main.py.

In next period, I will extend my class. To add more function inside my databse class. 

What's more, after display, I got the idea that the sqlite3 does not fit my work. I need to choose a better database system to continue my development. I have two choose PostgreSQL or mysql. I will know about each databse quickly. And then make a decision.
