# Database in Lemma
--------------------

For Lemma, we want to create a website for host the homeword server part 
we want to use MySQL to store student imformation. What's more, as different 
student have different idea of solving the problems. Other students can reuse 
classmates' proofs. They can save their time if the logic argument can be reuse.
So in database system, I want to add this function that import others argument.
I will use MySQL database system to complete this work.

The first stage is installing MySQL, and let it work compatible with python.
This is not a easy job, I used two weeks to finish this part. 

The second stage is writing python classes to process the data and logic within 
the program. 

The third stage is combining database part with partner's GUI part. Then we can 
use GUI interface to do some user test.
